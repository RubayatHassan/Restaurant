                        <p className="py-6">One of the best parts about an open kitchen design is the integration of an island. This will often serve as the centerpiece to your cooking and entertaining, but we love how this kitchen design also makes it a visual focal point.

Keeping this center island predominantly white and utilizing high-contrast black on either side ensures your eye will always lead you to the visual interest of the space.</p>
