                EFG (Express Food Group) Co., Ltd., is a member of RMA Group.
                With increased disposable income and more modern lifestyles amongst urban and city dwellers, Cambodia’s hospitality industry has grown significantly within a very short time.  With this changing landscape, RMA Cambodia created Express Food Group (EFG) in 2005 as a sister company and has since contributed to the growth of the food and beverage market by bringing the leading international food chain franchises to the Kingdom.

                Today, EFG employs over 1,200 staff across six key brands — The Pizza Company, Swensen’s, Dairy Queen, Krispy Kreme and Bar BQ Plaza. With stores in the city and 6 provinces – Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Battambang, Sihanoukville, Takhmao (Kandal), Poi Pet (Banteymeanchey) and Kampong Cham – EFG has consistently offered world-class and professional quality food and beverages as well as unique dining experiences. In addition, EFG has strengthened its customer service by offering a single point of contact for home delivery service countrywide for any brand.

                The first franchise pizzeria in Cambodia, The Pizza Company opened its store on July 25, 2005 and has since been serving freshly-made dough pizza, pasta dishes, and salads to millions of customers every day across thirty outlets throughout Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, Battambang, Poi Pet and Kompong Cham. Considered the most preferred pizza in Cambodia among locals and foreigners alike, The Pizza Company is superior in all aspects – taste, store design and ambience, comfort, home delivery area coverage, variety of pizza crusts, sauces, and toppings as well as customer service. The Pizza Company is also proud of its strict “30-minute delivery or it’s free” policy.<br></br>
